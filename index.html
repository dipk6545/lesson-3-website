          Hi, myself Subhadip. I graduated in 2022 from ITER bhubaneswar. I
          didn't study at all during my collage days. Later on during my 3rd
          semestar I started learning programming in C++. later i got confused
          if I am on the right track. I thought of preparing for gate. During my
          C++ journey, I liked coding and solving question even though I stuck.
          I also change my language because I thought that C++ is a old language
          it is not too much in industry.
          I learned Java and Python too. Later I realised I am only focusing on
          language learning not skills so I shifted to web devlopment and them
          did some data anlysis in Python. Added some course from coursera
          through financial aid xd. During my 4th year placement season started.
          I cracked many companies finally i joined PwC as a Salesforce
          Developer. Now I want to learn web development coz i realised that
          salesforce is written on html css javascript. So why go and learn a
          product when you can learn how to make a product.
        </p>
